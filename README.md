This is a website called Animination that is using Giphy to show results for any and all relevant gifs related to anime!

You simply type in the search field anything you want and
it will show results related to an anime. Even writing something as simple as the keyword "cool"

This website was desgined using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some future implemntations could be:

    1) Providing a way for the gifs to come up more dynamically and be responsive as the user is typing rather than having to hit the enter button

    2) Adding a media query for tablet users or just an inbetween screen soulution between the dexktop and mobile versions.

    3) Having the search results return even more gifs back, or perhaps providng some kinda limiter.
